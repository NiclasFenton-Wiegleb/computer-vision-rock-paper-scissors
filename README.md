# Computer Vision RPS

This project aims to train a machine learning model that can determine if a human player is playing rock, paper or scissors with a webcam as input. The goal is to create an algorithm that can play the game with a human contestant. Please see below for the technologies used:

- Tensorflow (Model trained via https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/)


## Milestone 1

- The machine learning model was trained to recognise four classes: Rock, Paper, Scissors and Nothing. The training set contained 1300 images, 300 for each possible play and 400 for the Nothing class

- The files containing the model were downloaded from Teachable Machine and uploaded to this repository.

- The required dependencies can be found in the requirements.txt
